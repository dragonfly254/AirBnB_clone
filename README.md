         AirBnB clone - The console

The goal of the project is to deploy on a server a simple copy of the AirBnB website. It wonâ€™t implement all the features, only some of them to cover all fundamental concepts of the higher level programming track.

The console is a command line interpreter to manage the AirBnB
objects

Commands:
create - create an object
show - show an object (based on id)
destroy - destroy an object
all - show all objects, of one type or all types
update - Updates an instance based on the class name and id
quit/EOF - quit the console
help - see descriptions of commands

(hbnb)
